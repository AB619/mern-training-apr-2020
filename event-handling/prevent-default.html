        <!-- forms 
        
            1. form has an action - where exactly it gets submitted
            2. the form data get submitted using 2 methods
                GET     
                    data is sent in the request header
                    you can see it in the URL as query parameters
                    but this has a limitation, as header can accomodate less data
                    is not secure as anyone can see the data in the URL
                    ??
                
                POST
                    data is sent in the request body
                    you can not see this in request url
                    it is safe and secure
                    you can send large of data
            3. on click of submit, broowser will automatically submit the form
